### You have been asked to create three short, succinct tests on the topic of Genkō(era), which is one in history that you know well.

The first question should ask your student what he or she knows already; it can also include some background information if necessary but not too much detail as this will make answering later easier!

For example:""What do we call people who lived during these years?"" ""How many rulers were there?""

If possible try asking open-ended questions so they don't feel like homework! If all else fails then just tell them how long their essay"

He therefore decided to create something called ""Tamil Radar"" which would serve both purposes at once - providing information from India while also serving as a portal into all things related to South Asia!
